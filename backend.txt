- I want these details when we fetch a single provider
    1. Their schools
    2. Their partners

- The providers are the one who have partners and schools they work with not schools having partners and providers hence the eendpoints
/schools/{schoolId}/add-partner
/schools/{schoolId}/remove-partner
/schools/{schoolId}/add-provider
/schools/{schoolId}/remove-provider
/schools/{schoolId}/partners
/schools/{schoolId}/providers

All these endpoints need to rather be attached to a provider and as such when fetching a provider should return their schools and partners with the data 

Please add the bio or so to the provider too.

- Also for fetching schools, allow making type optional. Why? When adding a school to a partner, I should be able to get all the schools without passing a type

- Can't find an endpoint for a member

- For the schools, the status should be returned with the status so I can know to disable or enable hence the need for /schools/{schoolId}/enable or a single endpoint to toggle
